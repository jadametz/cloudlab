# goTweetDelete

I wrote [goTweetDelete](https://github.com/jadametz/gotweetdelete) to delete Tweets that are (in my case) older than 30 days.

## Setup

### Secrets

The following secrets are from the Twitter API:

* `accesstoken`
* `accesssecret`
* `consumerkey`
* `consumersecret`

The values for these secrets should be added after applying `secrets.yaml`.
